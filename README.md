### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This solo project took roughly 7 days or 50 hours to complete in my 12th week of an intensive boot camp for coding in JS development.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
This application was built by [Carissa Hluchan](https://github.com/CarissaHluchan).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Create a clear and accessible user interface
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- Accessibility: This was my first solo project addressing accessibility. I used the voice-over tool to test the application manually and applied ARIA elements to achieve this. I further tested accessibility using [WAVE](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US) and [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview).
- POST and DELETE API requests: My first solo project creating POST and DELETE API requests. I used a local server to build and test fetch calls then implemented [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the database to deploy the app.
- DOM manipulation: As my second solo project in vanilla JS I had to think critically about the functionality and test the site regularly. I‚Äôm excited to learn REACT and to apply libraries to handle the more challenging features, like the calendar date selection input field.
